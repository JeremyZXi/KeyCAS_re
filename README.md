This repo holds the code for the free public Silex instance hosted by Silex Labs foundation. This is a good example on how to customize Silex.

This code adds features to the editor specific to our instance:

* analytics - we use [microanalytics.io](https://microanalytics.io/) because it is green.
* debugging with Sentry
* a popin window which asks the user to rate the service on trustpilot
